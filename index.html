          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>This research investigated the impact of age and income on health outcomes by state.</p>

          <p>As the chart shows, states with a higher percent of their population at or below the poverty line 
          also tend to have a higher percent of their population classified as "Obese". This is particularly 
          worrying as states with higher rates of poverty also have lower rates of insured individuals. As
          the median household income of a state increases, rates of obesity and smoking decrease while the level
          of insured individuals increases.</p>

          <p>The impact of age on health outcomes is less apparent. States with older median age appear to have slightly
          higher rates of insured and a slightly higher percent of their population that smoke. While there is no clear 
          trend between obesity and median age.</p>

          <p>These findings suggest that health risk is compounded for states with a larger percent of households in poverty. 
          Higher rates of obesity and smoking put individuals at risk for serious medical issues. Simultaniously, this at risk
          population is also less likely to recieve treatment for these conditions due to decreased access to medical care.</p>
